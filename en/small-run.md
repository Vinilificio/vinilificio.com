# Small Run (10/20/30 vinyl records)


![infographic vinili](/img/PROMO-SMALL-RUNS_GFX_big-5.jpg)

The short-run service is particularly suitable for artists, record labels and DJs.

* We release audio on vinyl for your promos or limited editions in small runs without having to wait many months and commit to large quantities.
* Records are cut copy by copy on one or more machines. Each vinyl is unique, consider that there may be small differences between one vinyl and another.
* Before proceeding with the engraving of the series, we send a <b>test disc</b> to be approved by the customer. The cost of the test disc and shipping is the responsibility of the customer and will be deducted from the total amount of the order.
