### Vinificio Services


**ORDER VALIDITY:**

Orders will be considered valid only upon receipt of the due payment.


**ACCEPTANCE OF RESPONSABILITY ON THE PART OF THE CLIENT CONCERNING THE OWNERSHIP AND/OR LICENSE OF MASTERED AUDIO CONTENT:**

The audio material transferred by Vinilificio from a master onto a single support unit (vinyl) is solely and exclusively for professional and/or personal use (for back up and other uses) and not for free distribution or sales purposes. Vinilificio absolves itself form any responsibility related to the mastered audio content provided by the client to be transferred onto vinyl. In the case that an audio master is covered (wholly or partially) by copyright law, Vinilificio, in the person of Cristian Adamo, holds itself absolved from all responsibility deriving from consequences of abuses of subsequent uses and elaborations of the treated audiovisual material. The client who underwrites the order therefore assumes the total responsibility of discharging from all the obligations provided for by the copyright laws in force both on the national territory and according to international agreements.


**CLIENT ASSUMES RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONTENT AND QUALITY OF THE AUDIO MASTER AND GRAPHIC FILES:**

The client is responsible for the quality of the audio and graphic content supplied to Vinilificio for the audio master transfer service on vinyl records and for the quantity printing service. The client must read the technical specifications provided by Vinilificio on its web site and/or by email and provide materials according with Vinilificio specifications. No complaints will be accepted regarding the quality of the product made by Vinilificio in the case of non-compliant material. In the case of non-compliant material the client, before proceeding with the processing, can request support for the mastering service and/or graphic support. The mastering and/or graphic support services are activated only and exclusively upon the client's request and approval of the estimate.

**PROCESSING TIMES FOR SINGLE VINYL AND SMALL RUNS:**

Processing times for single vinyl or small runs vary between 20 and 50 working days. Times may vary depending on the type of order (vinyl format, master length, prints, quantity...). The customer unconditionally grants Vinilificio an additional 40 working days in the event of (but not limited to) quality problems encountered during production, problems with the supply of raw materials and semi-finished products, operator illness and other external factors such as extreme weather events, earthquakes, wars and pandemics.
Vinilificio is however obliged to communicate any delays to the client within 10 days from the date communicated in the order confirmation. At the end of the 40 days allowed the client has the right to request a refund of the amount paid for the production of the order.

**QUALITY, ORDER CANCELLATION AND REFUND:**

<i>Given that:
The customer is obliged to provide material that is qualitatively compliant with the specifications on our website. 

The media produced by Vinilificio are made exclusively with content provided by customers, for this reason Vinilifcio cannot transfer to third parties in any way the material produced.

Vinilificio carries out quality control both during production and before shipment.

Vinilificio ships with appropriate vinyl packaging. Any damages caused by mishandling of the package shall be considered quality production problems. More information can be found in “Shipping” in Terms and Conditions.</i>

1. In the event that the customer experiences quality problems due to the production of audio and/or graphic media produced by Vinilificio, the customer must send a communication via email to info@vinilificio.com no later than 8 days from the receipt of the order. The communication must include a clear description of any problems together with photographic and/or video documentation. If requested by Vinilificio, the customer must return the defective material for viewing. Shipping costs are borne by the customer and will be reimbursed by Vinilificio if the production defect is confirmed. Vinilificio must respond within 8 working days. If the production defect is confirmed, Vinilificio will remanufacture the item that has production problems at its own expense. Shipping costs are borne by Vinilificio. 

2. The customer has the right to cancel the order once payment has been made. 
* In the case of an order not yet in production, the refund will be issued within 14 days of receipt of the request. Vinilificio will deduct a flat fee of € 10.00 for the management and administrative costs incurred for the order cancellation. 

* In the event that the order has already been put into production, the refund will be issued within 14 days of receipt of the request. The customer must unconditionally bear a cost equal to 50% of the material already produced as a refund for the material used and a flat fee of € 10.00 for the management and administrative costs incurred for the order cancellation. The refund will be issued within 14 days of receipt of the request.”


3. The client has the right not to accept the order on delivery.

* In the event that the client decides to reject the order on delivery and send it back to the sender (Vinilificio), the client must unconditionally bear a cost equal to 50% of the material already produced as a reimbursement for the material used, plus a fixed cost of €10.00 for handling and administration. The refund will be issued no later than 14 days after return to the sender.


**SHIPMENTS**

Shipments are made at the risk and expense of the client. Vinilificio will inform the client of the shipping method, courier appointed, costs, shipping code. Under no circumstances is Vinilificio responsible for loss, damage, delays or other damage caused by the courier.
The client is obliged to inform the courier directly of any changes of address, updates relating to the services offered by the courier in charge. 
In the event of courier service failures, the customer may complain directly to the courier company in charge.


**INTERMEDIATION SERVICES FOR THE PRODUCTION OF VINYL RECORDS**

Vinilificio offers commercial and technical intermediation services between clients and the record industry for the production and duplication of audio on vinyl records. Furthermore, under no circumstances does Vinilificio make serial duplications from a matrix. The client who uses this service is obliged to fulfill all the required procedures for the permission of mechanical reproduction and copyright international laws with the authorized dealership in his native country.

The production time of the order will be communicated when the order is placed. Production times are not binding and may vary between the request for a quote and the placing of the order.

The delivery takes place within 120 working days at the latest, following receipt of the necessary documents and materials. The starting materials must be in perfect condition. If we are in default of delivery, the customer must set us a grace period of at least 6 weeks before they can withdraw from the contract.

Any dispute regarding the printing of vinyl records and products / services related to it and or offered by Vinilificio as intermediation, are sole and exclusive reference to the terms and conditions of the printing press. Any complaints should be directed exclusively to the product manufacturer. The client is entitled to be informed where the produciton of the order will take place.

*Change in Item to be Delivered/Part Performances/Additional or Reduced Production*

1. Provided there is no unreasonable negative effect for the customer as a result, we reserve the right to make technical changes to the item to be delivered, if this does not impair its technical function.

This point relates above all, but not only, to the final weight of the record, which can vary due to the production process. Deviations of up to plus / minus 10% do not constitute grounds for complaint.

2. Despite machine cleaning sporadic colour impurities may occur for production reasons. These minor colour variations do not entitle a complaint.

3. In the case of pressing orders, additional or reduced production is unavoidable. Over or under-deliveries up to 10 % are to be accepted by the customer. They will be billed accordingly.

4. We are entitled to provide part performances, provided the customer can be reasonably expected to accept them.

Any changes of the running order will be charged with a administrative fee of 30,00€
