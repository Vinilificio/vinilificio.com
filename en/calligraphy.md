### Your artist s vinyl record

We asked an artist and calligrapher to create the custom cover art for your single-copy record.

### What should I do

It's so easy, just send an email to <a href="mailto:info@vinilificio.com"> info@vinilificio.com</a> with object: _CALLIGRAPHY_ and we will be the ones to guide you step by step in creating your artist vinyl!!


### What we will ask you

* The audio files you would like to transfer on your vinyl record.
* The words that our calligrapher Cecilia will write for you on the cover ( max. 5/6 - a short sentence to bring out the beauty of the hand stroke and allow the graphics to breathe )
