# Audio mastering, optimization for vinyl, audio restoration

Each sound recording – whether vinyl, file, CD, DVD, or video – has its own technical characteristics (advantages and limitations). Mastering can adjust the audio for the support on which it will be transferred. Mastering is an essential process for making a high quality sound product (without errors) and especially for emphasizing those “colors” and “tones” that otherwise remain imperceptible.

Vinilificio provides mastering with digital/analog mixed paths, optimization of low quality audio, and audio restoration from vinyl.
