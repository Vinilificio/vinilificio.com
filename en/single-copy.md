### Audio

#### How much does it cost to record a vinyl?
Recording music on vinyl requires sophisticated equipment, in-depth technical knowledge, materials and above all attention, care and time.<br>
For example, to cut a 30-minute record, it takes between 40 minutes and an hour. That is 30 minutes for cutting (equal to the duration of the master) and between 10 and 30 minutes for set-up (depending on the condition of the master and the colour of the vinyl).
<br>The costs for engraving vary between € 20.00 and € 90.00 depending on the size of the vinyl, colour and duration (minutes) of the master.

#### How much music can you record on vinyl?

The amount of music engraved onto each side of a vinyl disc determines the volume of the recorded signal.

The groove of the vinyl record takes up more space when engraved at high volume, while it takes up less space when etched at low volume.

(-) each side = (+) volume

(+) each side = (-) volume


The best quality-quantity proportion is:

* 12″ to 33 rpm ​​at high volume max. 12 min.
* 12″ to 45 rpm at high volume max. 8 min.
* 10″ to 33 rpm ​​at high volume max. 8 min.
* 10″ to 45 rpm at high volume max. 6 min.
* 7″ to 45 rpm at high volume max. 4 min.


Quality-quantity ratio for 12″ 33 rpm:

* over 12 min. each side -> high volume
* 12 / 15 min. each side -> middle  high volume
* 12 / 15 min. each side -> middle high volume
* 15 / 20 min. each side -> middle low volume
* more than 20 min. each side (max. 25 minutes) -> low volume

#### Audio files and important advice
More or less any kind of audio signal can be recorded on vinyl. To obtain good quality, however, it is advisable to follow a few important guidelines.

Remember that the better the quality of the master, the better the quality of the audio recorded on vinyl. We always recommend appropriate mastering for vinyl.

We accept any type of digital audio format. wav, aiff, mp3...  

<i>For best performance we strongly recommend .wav or .aiff format. </i>

If you really want to transfer on vinyl compressed files formats such as mp3, do not convert them to any other file format.

The speed of the engraving (33/45/78 rpm) is another important factor affecting the quality of the groove reading along with the disc size (5‘/7’/10‘/12’). The closer you get towards the centre of the disc, the slower the stylus reads the groove. Decreasing the speed towards the centre of the disc results in a less accurate reading of the groove causing, among other problems, distortion. For the reasons mentioned above, qualitatively speaking it is not recommended (although technically possible) to record a 7’ format at 33 rpm.


**Low freqeunces:**

* Frequencies below 20 Hz can create resonance problems
* In order to avoid out of phase signals with consequent groove interruptions and hence, needle-jumping, it is advisable to keep MONO frequencies below 300 Hz
* Avoid out of phase signals if you do not have thorough mastering knowledge. To check if there are any out of phase signals use a “correlation meter” available in almost all audio programs.


**High frequences:**

* De-esser: We recommend using a de-esser on all voices and on all sibilants in general
* Frequencies above 14/15 kHz at very high volumes cannot be recorded
* For best results,  we recommend placing the tracks with higher frequencies at the beginning of the vinyl


**Do you want to know more?** 

[Look here at Rand Muzik specifications.](https://www.randmuzik.de/media/audio_specification_en_2.pdf)
* Please note that for the audio transfer service on single copy we do not use a Neuman system, but a special system designed especially for direct vinyl cutting. 

**Know nothing about audio mastering and don’t know what to do?** 

We can take care of your mastering. Contact us for information or [look here](/en/mastering/)
