# FAQ

### Audio transfer in single copy
It is a transfer (or transfer) of an audio master from a medium (usually digital, but not necessarily) to vinyl. The procedure involves the engraving of a virgin vinyl disc using a special diamond needle. The vinyl engraved in a single copy, represents a copy of the master (but not a duplication) and will be ready for listening, will have resistance to wear and sound just like a classic vinyl.

### Advantages of the transfer to vinyl
It is a unique vinyl, made "manually" by transferring the 1X audio. Quality and wear are virtually identical to an industrially produced vinyl. The audio transfer on vinyl is particularly suitable for those who need a single vinyl or in small runs.

### Audio transfer on lacquer disc
It is a transfer of an audio master from a medium (usually digital, but not necessarily) to a lacquer or acetate. The procedure involves the engraving of a disk usually of 14 "diameter composed of a metal disk, covered with a special lacquer / varnish which will then be engraved by a small needle of a sapphire. This special engraved record (not to be confused with the vinyl record) is the first step in the production of an industrial-scale vinyl. The sound quality of this disc is very high, but it undergoes a strong deterioration with each listening.

### Difference between printed vinyl and engraved vinyl
A vinyl record produced industrially involves the production of matrices that will be used to produce (by pressing) in series and in quantity copies of vinyl records all the same.

The vinyl engraved through an audio transfer process is a unique vinyl, made individually and not in series.

From the point of view of audio quality and wear, vinyl etched and industrially produced vinyl are very similar. However, there may be differences in the depth of the grooves, in the background noise (however present in any vinyl) and in the exaltation of some medium-high frequencies.

From the aesthetic point of view, the industrially produced vinyl has the typical herringbone edge (this is because it is pressed and trimmed), while the vinyl for the single copy transfer has a flat edge (because it is produced in sheets and cut with a cutter)

### How a vinyl is produced industrially

In a nutshell, the production of a vinyl takes place in this way:

1 - Audio transfer from the audio master to the lacquer. Two incisions are used to engrave side a and side b. One on each side.

2 - From the lacquers through the processes of silvering and galvanic baths, matrices (positive and negative) are produced, one on each side.

3- The negative matrices or "stampers", after being drilled in the center, cut to size and checked, are then used to print. Positive matrices are used as a mother to make other positive matrices and reprint.

4- Pressing tests are usually produced before going to press. The pressing test is nothing more than a printing test, produced in a few copies (may vary depending on the printing house) to verify that the product does not present any production defects. It is important to know that the pressing test is a printed vinyl exactly like the ones that will be produced in series afterwards. Therefore, if there are defects it is necessary to restart the entire production.

6- In the meantime, round labels are produced and placed in the center of the vinyl. The labels are printed on a special paper that is resistant to high temperatures.

7- Negative matrices or stampers or printers (side a and b) are placed in a press that injecting vinyl between the two matrices, high pressure and high temperature press the vinyl paste. The doily (label or label) is "glued" during the press.

8- The vinyl, still in the press, is trimmed to size.

9- After leaving the press, the vinyl is wrapped in the inner case and left to cool for around 24 hours.

10- Some printers automatically insert the vinyl into the case as soon as it comes out of the press, other printers insert the vinyl in the case after 24 hours.

### Test press
Pressing tests are usually produced before going to press. The pressing test is nothing more than a test print, produced in a few copies to verify that the product does not present production defects. It is important to know that the pressing test is a printed vinyl and is exactly the same as the ones that will be produced subsequently in series. Therefore, if there are defects it is necessary to restart the entire production. It is important not to confuse the pressing test with the audio transfer on vinyl. They are two different things, with different functions. To learn more, see [How a vinyl is industrially produced] (/ faq / # come-comes-industrially-a-vinyl)

### Why the test press
The test pressing is a very important tool in order to verify the quality of the matrices that will be used to produce the vinyl. The pressing test being a real printed vinyl will allow stable if there are defects such as tip jumps, excessive noise, closing the groove at the end of the stroke and so on. If the pressing test has real problems, it will be necessary to proceed with the production of the matrices (1-3) and carry out new pressing tests.

### Mastering
Mastering is a form of audio post-production. It is a process of preparing and transferring the recorded audio from a source containing the final mix on a data storage device (the master), ie the source from which all copies will be produced (by methods such as pressing, duplication or the reply). <br>
Mastering provides mainly (but not only) corrections on equalization, enhancement of dynamics, control of possible counter-phases.

### The importance of mastering
The mastering allows first of all to optimize the audio produced to the support on which it will be subsequently duplicated. A good record is not only the result of a good recording and a good mix but also a well done mastering. Never underestimate the mastering and rely on competent and experienced technicians. A bad mastering or a duplication of a mastering audio without mastering is synonymous of a disk that does not sound good! <br>
Before going to print always make sure of the quality of your master, listen to it on different systems and systems and, if you're not sure, make a vinyl audio transfer to have a probable test of what could be your master on vinyl.
